# Software Testing

Carrying out software testing is very important to ensure that the software functions correctly and according to predetermined specifications. Testing can identify errors that result in poor user experience. By conducting testing, software developers can improve the quality and confidence of the software before it is released to end users, thereby reducing the risk and cost of future improvements.

## Unit Test

Unit testing is a type of software testing that focuses on testing the smallest parts of the software with the aim of ensuring that each building component can function correctly. By performing unit tests, errors can be detected and fixed earlier in the development process, thereby improving code quality and making future maintenance easier.

## Snapshot Testing

Snapshot testing is a software testing method used primarily to test the user interface (UI) by comparing a newly taken snapshot with a previously saved snapshot. If there are differences, developers can check to see if the changes indicate a bug. This method helps ensure that changes in the code do not inadvertently change the appearance or behavior of the approved UI.

##  Testing

Automation testing is the process of using scripts to run tests on software automatically, without human intervention. The goal is to increase efficiency and consistency in testing by automating repetitive tasks that are typically time-consuming and prone to human error. With automated testing, testing can be done faster, more frequently, and in some scenarios will take longer than manual testing.
